### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Christian Beer and I am a software developer / engineer since many years and specialized on iOS and macOS app development in 2007.

I'm the developer of [iVocabulary](http://ivocabularyapp.com) and other apps found [here](http://apps.chbeer.de). 

Currently I'm working at [ZifferEins](http://ziffereins.de) where we're developing apps to improve transparency in [hunting](http://diwima.de) and for small food producers with our [Z1Label solution](http://z1label.com).

Previously I built the apps for [LVM](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/id597870341) (a local insurance company), [Deutsche Bank](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/deutsche-bank-mobile/id1040475847), T-Systems, [Rheinische Post](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/rp-online-aktuelle-nachrichten/id920407394). I also was part of a startup called ["dot dot dot"](https://www.pinterest.de/pin/120963939963572313/) (Pinterest link!).

A huge interest of mine is developing electronics using KiCad.
